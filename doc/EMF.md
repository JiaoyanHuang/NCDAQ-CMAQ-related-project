2. import files
  We cannot upload data from our local computers, please contact Susan McCusker at MARAMA
  - Susan McCusker <smccusker@marama.org>

if you click 
```
Manage>Datasets
```
you can see all available files in the server, which include control programs, measures, inventories, and strategies

3. edit Control Measures if necessary

from state agency viewpoint, we do not have the need to modify Control Measure, but if you would like to test certain air pollution   control methods you can go 
```
Manage > Control Measures
```
to add a new measure or to modify any existing measuure, the best way to do this is to copy a measure not edit a measure, and this will keep the new and original versions, or you can create a different version in the existing measure.

3. edit Control Programs if necessary

Control/Projeciton/Closure files
- we have to upload any control program files we would like to use in FF10 format through MARAMA staff eg NCDAQ_VISTASII_PROJECTION_File_Final (those files are ususally generated by Andy Bollman
- we select the one you would like to edit or copy a dunplicated version
```
Manage > Contorl Program
```
![control file](https://github.com/JiaoyanHuang/NCDAQ-related-projects/blob/master/EMF_State/control_program.PNG)
